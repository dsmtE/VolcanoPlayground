## Conventions

### File naming
snake_case : no matter what.
Class names should stay in PascalCase to match engine conventions (=> for a script, class name in PascalCase, filename in snake_case)

Don't hesitate to set git config core.ignoreCase to false, to ensure case sensitive file names are treated *as they are* (so we don't let casing issues propagate).
